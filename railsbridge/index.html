  <h2>RailsBridge</h2>

  <p>
    <a href="http://railsbridge.org">RailsBridge</a> workshops are a free and fun way to get started or level up with Rails, Ruby and other web technologies. Our events focus on increasing diversity in tech, so that people of all backgrounds can feel welcome and comfortable in our industry.
  </p>
  <p>
    This workshop is intended to reach out to women who are new to Ruby and Rails. Total programming novices, system administrators, developers in other languages, and folks who attended our previous workshops and need a refresher are all welcome. We'll have different groups separated by experience level. Men are welcome to attend but must be the guest of a female.
  </p>
  <p>
  We emphatically support transgender attendees and are queer-friendly. If you have any questions, <a href="mailto:desi.mcadam@gmail.com">Email Desi</a>
