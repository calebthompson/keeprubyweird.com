# Day after Agenda

Bet you thought Keep Ruby Weird was a one day event? Wrong! We tricked you into coming to Austin, and now we planned a whole day of food and activities to keep you busy. Choose your own adventure style. GO!

## Breakfast

The most important meal of the day. Except for second breakfast, and third lunch. Here's our recommendations to get your day started

- Franklin's: Not a traditional breakfast joint, Franklin's is known for their BBQ and their line. Bring a chair or rent one, just make sure to get there at least an hour and a half before they open or you're guaranteed to not get any. Make a group, bring some beers. The wait is part of they experience. Look for the Keep Ruby Weird shirts for cutsies.
- Cenote: Great brunch on the east side. Get the Eggs Benedict or Rockstar bagel.
- Veracruz: The best breakfast tacos @schneems has ever had. (trailer food)
- Austin Java: Pretty decent at everything. Huge breakfast menu
- [Farmers Market](http://www.sfcfarmersmarket.org/markets/sfc-farmers-market-downtown): Open 9am - 1pm on Saturdays.

Also see tacos (below) cause if you come to Austin and don't eat a breakfast taco, you didn't really see Austin.

## Coffee

- Houndstooth
- Cafe Medici

## Mid-morning activity

- Zilker Park: The park where Austin City Limits is held every year. Also home to world famous Barton Springs swimming hole and the [Zilker Zephyr](http://zilkerpark.org/zilker-park-amenities/zilker-park-train/) a tiny train you can ride around the park. There's trails to run on around the lake, grass to lounge on, hiking trails into the greenbelt, a huge playset area for kids.
- Cycle around Austin: Don't have a bike? Check out B-Cycle
- Tour the Capital of Texas. Located in the heart of Congress Street.
- Go boot shopping: A good Texas boot is an investment that will last a lifetime. As the leather breaks in, they mold to your feet. Wear while cattle wrangling, in rainy weather to keep your feet dry, or just cause you wanna look more Texan. Check out Cavenders, Allens, Sheplers.
- Clothing shopping: Pearl snaps and hoop skirts your thing? Check out the shops on South Congress. There's a wide variety of unique stores, including non-clothing options like antiques.
- First ever Whole Foods: Did you know Whole Foods was started in Austin? Go check them out, grind your own cashew butter, eat some freshly prepared all raw zucchini noodle pad-thai, grab a beer, or a coffee, or one of the dozen other items sold at various stations inside of this mega feel-good grocery store.
- [Graffiti Park](http://www.yelp.com/biz/austins-graffiti-park-austin): Beautiful in the most austin way possible, bring your camera
- [BMX and Skate Park](http://www.yelp.com/biz/austin-bmx-and-skate-park-austin): Close to the graffiti park. Bring your own board and helmet. There's a shop around the corner if you're in the market.

## Lunch

Tacos and BBQ deserve their own sections. If you didn't wake up in time for breakfast, many places still offer brunch, or a few do all day breakfast. In the mood for something more substantial? Here you go:

- See Tacos
- See BBQ
- See Veggie notables
- Frank: A fine proprietor of Pork and it's tasty friends. Frank makes their own sausage. Try a bacon Bloody Mary or a meat-infused "Makers and Bacon". It's in the historic Warehouse District.
- Easy Tiger: Bakery and German Biergarten. They also make their own sausage. Outstanding on all counts. Come back for beer after the sun goes down.
- Hopdoddy: The best burger joint in Austin. They feature home-made buns and perfectly pressed patties. They've got spiked milkshakes it that's what you're into.
- Casino El Camino: The best burger you've ever had from a bar, not being sarcastic, it's freaking great. Close to downtown. Beware: It's pretty weird.

## Mid-afternoon activity

- see Mid-morning activity
- Kayak: If it's warm enough, you can rent kayaks from the [Zilker Boat Company](http://www.zilkerboats.com/).
- Stand up paddle boarding: like kayaking but way more hipster
- Quest Cable park: A 20 minute drive out of the city gives you access to a state of the art wake boarding cable park. Expect to dedicate 2 hours or more if you've never done it before. [Lessons available](https://questatx.com/parties-camps-lessons/). It may be chilly.
- [iFLY indoor skydiving](https://austin.iflyworld.com/): It's a bit pricy, but a very unique experience. A massive vertical wind tunnel lifts you up as an instructor keeps you from tumbling out of control.
- Bob Bullock Museum: If you like museums.
- [Texas Trail Rides](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g30196-d2659360-Reviews-Texas_Trail_Rides-Austin_Texas.html): If the other events have you saying Neigh! Maybe horses are your thing
- [K1 Speed](http://www.k1speed.com/arrive-and-drive.html): Real-life Mario Kart. Give the “Luigi death stare” as you overtake your opponents in these karts that go to 45 MPH. That is, if you can take the hairpin turns without wiping out.
- Red's Indoor Range: Whether you're for or against arming bears, there's no denying firearms played a part in the history of Texas. Gain an appreciation and respect for the devices in this indoor firing range. They offer firearms for rent as well as [lessons](http://www.redsguns.com/oneonone.html). Never ever operate a gun after consuming alcohol, be safe.
- Circuit of the Americas Track Rental: Have $55k to burn? Can we be your friend? Also can we borrow your Porsche?

- Tour one of [Austin's breweries](http://365thingsaustin.com/2013/02/08/a-guide-to-austins-brewery-tours/)

## Dinner

- Most of the places from lunch are also good, lower cost dinner options.
- La Condessa: Fine upscale Tex-Mex dining. Friends don't let visitors eat at the Iron Cactus.
- Peche: An absinthe bar with outstanding upscale American cuisine.
- Backspace: Wood fired pizzas close to downtown. Consider a reservation.
- G'Raj Mahal: Indian food on Rainey street. Make a reservation if you don't want to wait.
- Daruma Ramen: Good Ramen right downtown.
- Food trucks. Be on the look out for Chi' Lantro.

## Tacos

Tacos deserve their own sub-heading. Austin has some of the most unique and delicious styles of tacos we've ever come across. These are Tex-Mex-style soft tacos which are huge if you're comparing to traditional style. Order two or if you're super hungry three. Better yet get some chips and queso and wash it down with a Topo Chico.

- Torchy's: They've got the best chips and queso. Get the chips and queso. Also the tacos are pretty good.
- Taco Deli: Huge selection of craft tacos. Chips and queso suck compared to torchy's, but are still decent. Get the "akaushi picadillo" or "cowboy" tacos (if you eat red meat). The Mojo fish taco is also great.
- Veracruz: Super small taco joint on the east side. They've been featured on Food Network and are amazingly simple yet delicious tacos.
- Annies at the Airport: Near gate 20, if you're craving a breakfast taco fix, and flying in the morning, it's the best in the airport.

Torchy's versus Taco Deli is somewhat of a religious question in Austin. For optimal taco mecca status: try them both.

## BBQ

In Texas it's all about the slow smoked, melt in your mouth beef brisket. If you eat meat get some while you're in town. If not, find someone who does and enjoy their face while they eat the best thing to put on sliced bread.

When ordering you pick your meat type and tell them a weight. Half a pound is a pretty good sized portion usually for one meal. You can choose between "fatty" brisket and "lean". Brisket has a fat layer on one side that slowly melts as it cooks to give brisket it's distinct flavor. In "lean" brisket they cut this off before serving, "fatty" leaves it on. Don't forget your favorite sides like potato salad or cole slaw. If you're eating with friends, order a half pound each and share them all.

- Franklin's: Get there 2 hours before they open. Bring beer and a chair. This place is an institution. If you drop off someone to save your spot, there's a beer/grocery store up the street called "quickie pickie" where you can grab a few six packs and maybe some water.
- La BBQ: A trailer on the east side. They serve "free" (for a donation) lone star light (which is almost considered a beer by Texas standards) while you're in line. They'll have a pretty good wait, but shouldn't be as bad as Franklins. They will run out though.
- [Kreuz](http://kreuzmarket.com/): No BBQ sauce, no utensils. They sell meat and give you a place to sit. This place is in Lockhart texas which is about a 45 minute drive. If you love good BBQ this place is worth the drive, also a different style.
- Salt Lick: Famous for their "all you can eat" deal. They're about an hour out of town, worth mentioning but honestly… it's not our favorite. Too touristy. A pound of brisket is far more than most people can eat and costs less. Notable for their open pit style of BBQ, they're capable of seating and serving large parties easily, though expect a wait. Coolers allowed (beer, wine, etc.) outside while you wait.
- [Stubbs](http://stubbsaustin.com/gospel-brunch): It's downtown, and the sauce is really good. They also have a concert venue there. Rudys is probably better. If you're staying for Sunday: hit Gospel Brunch.
- Rudy's: "The worst BBQ in Texas". Despite the name, it's more than adequate. It won't melt in your mouth like Franklins, but if you're new to brisket you probably will walk away singing its praises anyway. There's multiple locations in Austin, short lines, and friendly staff. Make sure to tell the clerks "this is my first time" and they'll give you a great menu walk through. Also look for the famous hand washing machines and "i washed my hands" stickers. With as good and easy as Rudy's is to get you have no excuse for not eating BBQ while you're in Austin.

Warning: Too much meat can result in food coma. Don't meat and drive. Maybe grab a coffee afterwards.

## Veggie notables
Silicon valley might be all about getting the green, but Austin knows how to make some great greens. Even if you're not a vegetarian, these places are so good, they're staples in our regular circuit.

- Bouldin Creek: Cool summer sammich is amazing. Add fakon (fake bacon) and feta cheese for extra amazing.
- Counter Culture: Get the Reuben or the special of the day.
- Veggie Heaven: Even if you're not veggie, it's still amazing chinese food. Get the protein 2000.
- Mr. Natural: Go for lunch, they have a cafeteria style special every day. Ask the staff for recommendations.
- Leaf: Gourmet salads built in front of you chipotle style, only open for lunch.
- Juice Land: They were into juice before it was cool, also totally not hipster. Enjoy this local Austin juice startup with delicious and refreshing flavors. Ninja Bachelor party for something green and spicy.
