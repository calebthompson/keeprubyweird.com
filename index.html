  <h2>Special Guest: Matt Pollock Master Pun Meister</h2>
  <p>
    Fact: Rubyists love puns. Double Fact: Austin hosts the world championships of puns, known as the <a href="http://punoff.com/">O.Henry Pun off</a>.

  <p>
    We've brought world renowned pun slinger Matt Pollock, to take on the Ruby community. What does that mean? We're looking for volunteers to battle Matt in a live <a href="https://vimeo.com/42483574">Pun off [video]</a>. He'll single handedly take on a team of Keep Ruby Weird attendees as you work together to topple the Pun Meister. Participants will all get a prize and the winner will get something exceptionally weird. If you think you've got what it takes volunteer by emailing <a href="mailto:organizers@keeprubyweird.com?subject=Pun-The-World">the Organizers</a>.
