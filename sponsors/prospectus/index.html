  <p>
    Keep Ruby Weird aims to bring back some of the wonder and playfulness of Ruby, while also capitalizing on Austin's own "weirdness" culture to make a really fun and interesting conference.
    We want to make sure that the Austin and Ruby communities really benefit from this.
    That's why we're endeavoring to work with local companies whenever possible.
    We're also setting aside a portion of the tickets as a scholarship program.
    We don't want the reason that someone doesn't come to the event to be price.
  </p>

  <p>
    We're also committed to providing a safe and harassment free environment.
    See our <a href="/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <p>
    Keep Ruby Weird can't happen without help from sponsors.
    We have a few different sponsorship levels, and of course we're open to other arrangements.

  <h2>Other sponsorship levels</h2>

  <p>
    We also have limited availability for sponsoring specific parts of the conference.
    These sponsorships are more dependent on what you and your company are comfortable with doing, but we'd like to be involved in the planning.
    These can be in addition to or instead of other sponsor levels.
  </p>

  <h3>Afterparty sponsor</h3>
  <p>Organize an afterparty for the conference. Downtown Austin has plenty of great places to socialize at night, and we're happy to offer suggestions for places to do this.</p>

  <h3>Lanyard sponsor</h3>
  <p>Have your branding on every person's neck.</p>

  <h3>Event sponsor</h3>
  <p>We'd like to organize a DevChix event and a RailsBridge workshop.</p>

  <p>The <a href="http://www.devchix.com/">DevChix</a> events are usually a meetup/dinner/lunch of some sort for women developers to get together and generally meet, share, and be merry.</p>

  <p>
    <a href="http://railsbridge.org/">RailsBridge</a> workshops are a 2 day event.
    The install-fest takes about 3 hours and is typically done on an evening and the workshop day is a full 8 hour day.
    The workshop is for women and men (as long as they are the guest of a woman) and is LGBT friendly and welcoming.
    It is for beginners to Ruby and Ruby On Rails, either completely new to programming or simply new to the language.
    We would love sponsors for snacks/beverages on the installation night, food/beverages for lunch on workshop day, bagels/coffee for breakfast on workshop day and space to hold the event.
