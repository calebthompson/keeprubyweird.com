  <h2>Guide Application</h2>
  <p>
    Think about your first conference. What do you wish someone had told you? What do you wish someone had showed you? At Keep Ruby Weird, we offer an <a href="/scholarships/apply/">Opportunity Scholarship</a> to those that would not be able to attend a conference otherwise. We pair scholarship recipients with guides to show them around.
  </p>
  <p>
    As a guide it is your goal to make your attendee's conference experience a better one. You will be tasked with being a resource to your assigned scholarship recipient. You will be expected to remain available for their questions and to help them connect to others at the conference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Being a guide is a great excuse to go talk to speakers and introduce them to your attendee. It's a great way to meet other guides and other conference attendees. Make a difference in someones life today, apply to be a guide today.
