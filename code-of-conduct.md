<section class="white">

  Keep Ruby Weird is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference
  experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference
  participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
  conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules
  may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the
  discretion of the conference organizers.

  Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity
  and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
  race, age, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation,
  stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of
  talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
  attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
  comply immediately.

  If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may
  take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
  expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice
  that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
  a member of conference staff immediately.

  Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security
  or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
  experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
  value your attendance.
