## Join us

We'll be using Kickstarter to raise money for Keep Ruby Weird.

You will be able to purchase tickets, sponsor the conference, or even just get a t-shirt by
pledging there.

We're not quite ready to launch yet, but if you leave your email we'll let you
know when we are.

## Call for Proposals

We're inviting keynote speakers, but we are running a CFP for the rest of our
speaking slots.
